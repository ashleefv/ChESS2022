# ChESS2022
Numerical Problem Solving across the Curriculum with Python and MATLAB Using Interactive Coding TemplateS

Workshop materials from the 2022 Chemical Engineering Summer School

## Description

This workshop explores Python and MATLAB templates and interactive coding notebooks for use throughout chemical engineering core courses and computational thinking as a problem solving approach. Students do not need prior Python or MATLAB programming to use these templates. 

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to
-	Create interactive coding templates (MATLAB Live Scripts or Jupyter Notebooks using Python) for teaching chemical engineering concepts and problem-solving
-	Select, run, and interact with a MATLAB Live Script or Jupyter Notebook template applied to a chemical engineering topic of their choice

## Presenters
- Ashlee N. Ford Versypt
- Robert Hesketh
- Matthew Stuber
